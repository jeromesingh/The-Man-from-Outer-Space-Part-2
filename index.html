  <p class="bible">Revelation 3:14-21 KJV  And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the
  faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;  (15)  I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor
  hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.  (16)  So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee
  out of my mouth.  (17)  Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest
  not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:  (18)  I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
  in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy
  nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.  (19)  As many as I love, I rebuke
  and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.  (20)  Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice,
  and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.  (21)  To him that overcometh will I
  grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.

  </p>

  <p class="bible">Acts 1:7-11 KJV  And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in
  his own power.  (8)  But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses
  unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.  (9)  And when
  he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.  (10)  And
  while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;  (11)  Which
  also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into
  heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.

</p>

  <p class="bible" >Revelation 1:4-7 KJV  John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and
  which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;  (5)  And from Jesus Christ,
  who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that
  loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,  (6)  And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his
  Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.  (7)  Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall
  see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.

</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 24:30-31 KJV  And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the
earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  (31)  And he
shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds,
from one end of heaven to the other.

</p>

<p class="bible">Revelation 6:14-17 KJV  And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island
were moved out of their places.  (15)  And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief
captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the
mountains;  (16)  And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the
throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:  (17)  For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?

  </p>

<p class="bible" >1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 KJV  But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that
ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.  (14)  For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.  (15)  For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we
which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.  (16)  For the Lord
himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead
in Christ shall rise first:  (17)  Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the
clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.  (18)  Wherefore comfort one another with
these words.

</p>

<p class="bible">Philippians 3:8-11 KJV  Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,  (9) 
And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of
Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:  (10)  That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and
the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;  (11)  If by any means I might attain unto the
resurrection of the dead.

</p>

<p class="bible">Psalms 104:1-4 KJV  Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and
majesty.  (2)  Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:  (3) 
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the
wind:  (4)  Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

</p>

<p class="bible">Psalms 68:15-17 KJV  The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.  (16)  Why leap ye,
ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.  (17)  The
chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.

<h5>What will be happening on Earth?</h5>

<p class="bible">Isaiah 24:1 KJV  Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and
scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.

</p>

<p class="bible">John 5:25 KJV  Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the
Son of God: and they that hear shall live.

</p>

<p class="bible">John 5:28-29 KJV  Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his
voice,  (29)  And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done
evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Corinthians 15:22-26 KJV  For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.  (23)  But every man in
his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.  (24)  Then cometh the end, when
he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority
and power.  (25)  For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.  (26)  The last enemy that shall be
destroyed is death.

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Corinthians 15:50-54 KJV  Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither
doth corruption inherit incorruption.  (51)  Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
changed,  (52)  In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead
shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  (53)  For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this
mortal must put on immortality.  (54)  So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall
have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
